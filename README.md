# creditfraud

Credit card fraud detection is a key area in financial data analysis, as fraudulent activities can lead to significant financial losses for banks and other financial institutions. Further, the ability to proactively determine credit applications likely to result in default benefits the financial security of both the borrower and lender as they can be rejected before complications arise. Therefore, our primary goal is to explore the factors influencing credit card loan defaults to gain insight into early indicators and attempt to accurately assess the validity of loans. To achieve this, we have elected to explore the performance using four different models and data-mining techniques: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Tomek Links, XGBoost which utilizes a tree-based method, and a deep neural network called TabNet.

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle with the title "Credit Card Fraud Detection" by user "mishra5001". The dataset contains approximately 300,000 data points and 122 variables. To improve data quality, variables with duplicate values and missing rates greater than 20% are removed, and data points with missing entries are also discarded. This leaves 244,000 data points and 70 variables.
